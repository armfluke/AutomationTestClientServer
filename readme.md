### Required:
* Only a Node.js environment is required. On a command line, we require to have node and npm commands. That's it, nothing more. Other tools such as the TypeScript compiler, grunt or typings tools are automatically integrated in the dev enviromennt. Installing or having any of these tools already globally installed will have no effect on your build environment.
* npm 3+ is required. You could either update your npm package if you are using a Node.js < 5. If not, we recommend installing a 5+ Node.js.

### Installation

 * ```git clone https://Thanakit.Songsirisuk@git.sami.int.thomsonreuters.com/Thanakit.Songsirisuk/ClientExpress.git```

 * ```npm install```
* Go to config.json file to setup server's IP address and check relevant details regarding download location and more (i.e. ports)

* Start the testing process by sending your IP address to server
 * ```npm start```
 * Wait for the server to initialize the testing
